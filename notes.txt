** TO DO **

Loading animations (npm skelton?)

Error handling, especially for query params
  (Handle pages with params missing/invalid)
  (Handle pages that break rules, EG results for private scenario)

change NextJS Link to ../src/Link ?

deleting results for owners

hide firebase config

users db might not be secure
  
make results page the list of results if user, otherwise redirect to login page

make back navigation from results or survey back to create retain the option to sign in

when in create and click create the page resets

create 
  ~ check fbuser to avoid uncesseary signin


put about and profile in footer, make footer

put some user info in header for dev purposes, maybe make the navbar conditional on user . display user's email and offer option to log out

i really don't wanna, but I really ought to figure out redux with firebase

record full string and individual keywords. so just add a 'complete string' field to database and retrieve that in results

make sure contents pane reflects sign out

put more stuff in InfoBar, out of content pane

click 'create' in navbar should reset create form?

infobar is rerendering during form inputs on create. possible elsewhere? check all components for excessive rendering

draft survey should not be interactive
