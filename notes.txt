** TO DO **

Loading animations (npm skelton?)

click 'create' in navbar should reset create form?

profile button confused between signin process and already signed in? the problem may not exist in production

in /survey option to submit again?

forward to /profile rather than '/' after delete

sort keywords in /results 
put anchor in /results to phrases in case of really long results

finish results.js signin flow. can either go to profile or preferably to original results page
