** TO DO **

Loading animations (npm skelton?)

Error handling, especially for query params
  (Handle pages with params missing/invalid)
  (Handle pages that break rules, EG results for private scenario)

change NextJS Link to ../src/Link ?

hide firebase config


record full string and individual keywords. so just add a 'complete string' field to database and retrieve that in results

put more stuff in InfoBar, out of content pane

click 'create' in navbar should reset create form?

draft survey should not be interactive?


profile button confused between signin process and already signed in? the problem may not exist in production

in /survey option to submit again?

forward to /profile rather than '/' after delete, which means I need to:

**USE FUXORING REDUX DAMNIT YOU LAZY TARDBREATHBARRRGGGG **

sort keywords in /results 
put anchor in /results to phrases in case of really long results
